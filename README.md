# A model of the neuromuscular system

This repository contains a computational model of the human neuromuscular system implemented using the NEURON simulator (http://neuron.yale.edu) with Python and the module NetPyNE.

# Environment

There are two ways of preparing your device to run the model:
1. installing Python, NEURON and NetPyNE manually; 2. Use the docker image.
